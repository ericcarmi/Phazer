This is a Phazer - a signal is sent through allpass filters and mixed with the dry signal.
An LFO (low frequency oscillator) varies the frequency of the filters to create the effect.


Options: 
- Number of allpass filters
- Oscillator type
- Rate  : LFO frequency
- Freq  : Corner frequency of allpass filters
- Depth : Location of the filter's pole
- Width : Bandwidth of oscillation relative to corner frequency
- Mix   : Mix amount, positive or negative
